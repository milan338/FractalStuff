## Report Bugs and Feature Requests using GitHub's Issue Tracker

We use GitHub issues to track bugs.

## Follow a Consistent Coding Style

Some general guidelines:
- `snake_case` for variable names
- `PascalCase` for class, object, and method names
- Try to use explicit typing when declaring variables over `var`

Where readability can be improved, however, exceptions can of course be made.
